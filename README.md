I created a project to show how to use the cypress. 

  - It sum two inputs fields
  - Clear all inputs
  - To do cypress testing

# How to use!

  - The first step, you will need to do the clone of this repository
  - After cloned this repository, you need run these commands:
  
```sh
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
$ yarn cypress:open
```


Look that:
  - If you want use the cypress in your project, you should run the: ``` $ yarn add cypress ```
  - Is important to configurate the cypress.json to same url of project
  - Create your .spec.js and write your test code ;)
